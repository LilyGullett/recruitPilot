12:07-12:55 49 minutes (52 including middle break), 1351 photos
changed white balance, distance from rack (still macro but instead of one plug and little overlap or six whole plugs in the photo there are around 6 but some is cut off), raceway changed, and side of raceway with extra height under top right foot to even rack out

 The pink still doesn't look great but the purple ortho came out really well.

 The orthos are all complete

 T0 is way more blue than the T1 version.  I feel like recruit visibility may have actually decreased with the whitebalance (T1) however celia would need to be the one to make that call. 
I need to mess around with exporting to get the zipties on the same side.

T0 is way darker and more purple than T1, and I think that might make recruits easier to see contrast wise (especially considering how small they are in the very beginning) however they're about the same to me when looking at each plug in number I can actually identify on them. 
The color in T1 is more realistic and once they begin picking up their symbionts I believe it will be easier to see with the whitebalance. 
Zip ties line up

T0 again is much darker than T1 and this leads to more contrast without symbionts. I think it is easier to see the recruits at least on the pink in T0 however part of that could be attributed to the fact that there were 1k more photos taken of T0. 

How to improve? 
- go through and redo without blurry photos
- I wonder what the room with lights on would look like, so maybe doing a test with a small section or whole rack with the lights on and the overheads as well and auto whitebalance in order to see if we get some contrast but not an intense amount. 

match up manual counts with the orthomosaics**
