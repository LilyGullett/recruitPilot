We determined the best practices thus far by using trial scans and generating the products. 

Determined that macro works better to pick up on coral recruits than non macro from the surface. 
The background we picked was the waterproof paper as it is matte so it reduces glare and leads to cleaner products since there isn't noise between plugs. 
White light works to pick up coral recruits even in their smallest stage and blue light is harmful for corals over long periods of time so initial scans will be done in white light.
